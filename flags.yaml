# Lovefield-ts compile time configuration file
#
# TypeScript 2.8 does not support compile-time flags. As a result, this YAML
# file is used to generate flags.ts which will be compiled together with
# the source code. You can override the values by providing command line
# arguments when invoke gulp.

Flags:
  # Debug mode: in debug mode, full assertion and error messages will be
  # compiled into dist.
  DEBUG: true

  # Makes Lovefield to support in-memory DB only without data persistence.
  # When set to true, in-memory DB will be created regardless storeType
  # specified in connect options.
  MEMORY_ONLY: false

  # NATIVE_ES6 is always true in TypeScript port.

  # Provides default URL for exception look up.
  # When set to empty string, Lovefield will not generate URL in exceptions.
